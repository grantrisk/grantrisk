  - Buffed is an application, built with **Flask**, to allow the average person to look up recommended meals throughout the day. This is based on the calorie limit as well as the macronutrient proportions they wish to achieve. This application is targeting individuals looking to improve their health through nutrition and dieting. It provides a user-friendly interface for those looking to improve their health and physique, whether they are at home or on the run. This project was a school project and remains inactive. To get meal information it used the Edamam API.
